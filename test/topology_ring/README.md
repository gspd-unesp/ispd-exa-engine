# Model Testing #1

The model being tested here is composed of three logical processes being them one master `M`, one link `L` and one machine `m`.

 * The topology being tested is: M -> L -> m.

 * An amount of `1.000` (a thousand) tasks is being scheduled by the master to the machine passing through the link.

Further, all generated tasks arrive at master at `0` and all of the tasks have the **same** workload.
